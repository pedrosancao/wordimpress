# Wordimpress

Static site generator library that uses Wordpress API as content source. The library still a prototype.

## Key features

- uses Twig as template engine
- convert images to WebP format
- supports markdown to HTML

## Usage

Example of usage is available on [Bootstrap Template](https://github.com/pedrosancao/wordpress-static-bootstrap-template).

## To do list

The following tasks are my current priorities:

- Add paginations for all posts and category posts;
- Iterate API to get more then 100 of each resource;
- Load data from tags;
- Generate tags pages;
- Generate author pages;
